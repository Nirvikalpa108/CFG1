# Code First Girls - Week 1
I started [Code First Girls](https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/) (an 8 week introduction to coding, meeting once a week for 2 hours) at [Entrepreneur First](https://www.joinef.com/) in Bermondsey, London. 

Here is the first week of work! We created a website with HTML, CSS and a little Javascript from what we learnt in class and using General Assembly's **amazing** free [Dash tutorial](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/projects).
Thank you CFG and all your phenomenal volunteers- you guys are the best!
